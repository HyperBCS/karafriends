## Building

Dependencies

- Node.js, plus any `yarn` on your PATH (`npm install -g yarn` is enough). The repo pins its Yarn version in `.yarn/releases` via `yarnPath`, so whichever `yarn` you run hands off to it; corepack isn't needed.
- Rust

## Running

```sh
yarn install && yarn run-dev
```

`yarn install` puts dependencies in `node_modules` and keeps its download cache in `.yarn/cache`. Neither is committed.

## Development

```sh
yarn typecheck && yarn lint && yarn test:unit
```

The main process serves the phone remote and a JSON API on the remote port (8080 by default), for the phones:

- `POST /api/<method>`: JSON in and out. `src/common/api.ts` has the methods and their types, `src/main/api.ts` the handlers, and `src/common/apiQueries.ts` the clients' TanStack Query hooks.
- `GET /api/events`: the live state (queue, now playing, playback, key, downloads) as Server-Sent Events.

The display window uses the same methods and live events over Electron IPC, through its preload (`src/common/ipc.ts`, `src/main/ipc.ts`); `src/common/apiClient.ts` picks the transport.

There's no code generation: `yarn typecheck` works on a fresh checkout. A checkout from before GraphQL was removed may still have gitignored `src/**/__generated__` folders, which now fail the type check; delete them.

### Smoke tests

The Playwright smoke tests drive the karaoke display and the phone remote (in an emulated Pixel 7). `yarn test:e2e` and `yarn test:e2e:ci` test the production build in `build/prod` and don't build it, so run `yarn build-prod` first, and again after changing the app. Install Chromium (into `node_modules`) once:

```sh
yarn build-prod
yarn test:e2e:install
yarn test:e2e
```

- Each test launches the app muted, with a throwaway profile and temp folder and a free port, so it never touches your queue or config and can run next to the real app.
- `@net` tests queue a YouTube video. They copy ffmpeg and yt-dlp from the installed app's data folder (`%APPDATA%\karafriends\externalResources` on Windows), so start the app once beforehand.
- `@jp` tests search DAM and Joysound with the logins from the installed app's `config.yaml`, queue a song from each (the Joysound one downloads, with the installed app's ffmpeg) and take it straight off the queue. They need a Japanese IP and only run on request: `KARAFRIENDS_E2E_JP=1 yarn test:e2e --grep @jp`.
- There's no GraphQL any more: a test checks that `/graphql` answers 404, and every test fails if the display or the remote requests it.
- `yarn test:e2e:ci` leaves out `@net` and `@jp`; CI runs it on Windows and Linux.
